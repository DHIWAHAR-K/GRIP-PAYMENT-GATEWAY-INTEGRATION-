# Payment Gateway Integration

## Overview

This project demonstrates Payment Gateway Integration using PHP, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The integration allows users to make secure online payments using the provided web interface. In this example, we'll assume you've integrated a specific payment gateway using PHP scripts.

## Project Structure

- `index.php`: Main HTML and PHP file containing the payment form and integration logic.
- `style.css`: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) file for styling the payment form.
- `bootstrap/`: Folder containing Bootstrap CSS and JS files for responsive design.
- `images/`: Directory for storing relevant images or logos.

## Integration Steps

Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DHIWAHAR-K/GRIP-PAYMENT-GATEWAY-INTEGRATION-/tree/main
```
Configure Payment Gateway:

Locate the relevant PHP script for handling payment transactions (e.g., payment_handler.php).
Update the script with your payment gateway credentials and settings.

Run the Project:

Deploy the project on a PHP-supported server (e.g., Apache).
Open the index.php file in a web browser.

Test Payments:

Use the provided payment form to simulate transactions.
Check the server logs or payment gateway dashboard for transaction details.

## Customization

Modify the HTML and CSS files to match your website's branding and design.
Adjust the PHP scripts to integrate with a different payment gateway if needed.
Add additional features, such as order summary, user authentication, or email notifications.
